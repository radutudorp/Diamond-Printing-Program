Chapter 4: Program Control

4.31 (Diamond-Printing Program) Write a program that prints the following diamond shape. Your printf statements may print either one asterisk (*) or one blank. Use nested for statements and minimize the number of printf statements.

4.32 (Modified Diamond-Printing Program) Modify the program you wrote in Exercise 4.31 to read an odd number in the range 1 to 19 to specify the number of rows in the diamond. Your program should then display a diamond of the appropriate size.
